But the heads thought we could do it, so we obliged.\"\n\n\"Hm. What came of your project?\"\n\n\"Once prototyping was complete, we began the human trials.

It was a travesty. Some of them were simply too far gone. There was nothing we could do. Those were the best cases. Worse was when they rejected the replacements. Some died in a swift immune response. The more cognisant ones begged for us to end the headaches they were having. Some of them just started screaming. They'd scream for hours and hours, sometimes for days even. And then they'd stop. They'd literally scream themselves to death.\"\n\n\"That's, um, a bit unsettling. Is that all?\"\n\n\"There was one. One who made it through the replacement. And it worked wonderfully.

You have no idea how thankful I was to hear that he was doing well.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose that's good to hear. So, what's happened to him?\"\n\n\"You know? I'm not sure. Other than some behavioral changes, which is to be expected, he was able to return to society rather gracefully. We've done check-ups on him every three months to analyze long-term effects, but... Actually? Now that I'm thinking about it, he didn't show up for it last month. Oh, well. I'm sure he's doing fine. I'll have to contact him about that.\"\n\n\"Um, alright, then.

What a marvel it is, too. The sample resembles an earthen roundworm, but significantly bigger. I have assigned their common name as 'Detritive Trematode', and will describe their properties below.\n\n• Roughly two inches in diameter, and varying in size from about four inches to a foot and a half in length. White coloration.\n\n• These trematodes were found feasting on a pile of rotting meat in a damp cavern. The meat was of indeterminate origin, but the presence of other, larger animals is exciting nonetheless.\n\n• Upon scooping up a clump of the rotting meat, the trematodes quickly reacted to the movement and began wriggling around, before slowly relaxing. The guard positioned with me, Chevry, I think, was disgusted.\n\n• Upon touching one with an ungloved hand to feel their texture, one of the trematodes latched onto my palm and began chewing. It was extremely painful, both to have the trematode on my hand, and when Chevry cut the thing off. Despite that, other than a light gash on my palm, I believe I am fine.\n",

		"EQUIPMENT_GREATERWARBANNER_LORE": "<style=cMono>Recording from the Terran Museum of Tactics and Warfare.</style>\n\nSome say that one of the most important resources on the battlefield is morale. The functionality of a unit is exponentially increased depending on the mood of the troops within it. This can be raised or lowered through various means. For example, the quality of their lodging or food, news they've heard from their home, or even spending time recreationally.\n\nHowever, one tried and true method of raising the morale of a unit is the usage of symbolism. Many armies would wear colors and designs symbolizing their beliefs and their strength. Many units would carry flags in order to keep their morale high in combat.\n\nThe usage of this method has also seen variations. While a flag bearer for a unit will increase morale, it has been observed that flags unique to higher ranking military will further increase the unit's morale. Should a Colonel or General's flag appear on the battlefield, the troops will be encouraged by the power they display, and in turn increase their own fighting prowess.\n",
